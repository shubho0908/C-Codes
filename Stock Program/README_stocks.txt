Hey! Thanks for opening this project.
.
I planned this since 2 months but didn't get enough time to code it.
Still I'm lacking time to complete this project that's why I am sharing this project details and file with you so that you can also be a part of this amazing project based on Stock exchange program.
.
Now what's the ROADMAP?
-> I've create some of the basic structure of this program, your task will be that you've to write down the code for the particular functions that I've called under the conditions but didn't defined them till now. (Ps: I've lack of time & lazy tbh).
-> There are some of the functions you can find such as 
TS();  [Tata Steel]
TP();  [Tata Power]
TT();  [Titan]
RL();  [Reliance]

 *Please don't try to overwrite the name of the functions.*

I've defined a function 'TM()' you can follow the exact same pattern for the rest of the functions but do tweak with stock prices & the graph's movement.
.
*If you find the graph too complicated to edit than just copy paste the same don't change it.*
.

*IMPORTANT*
-> Also create a home page after when someone login in their demat account to choose which section they wanna go,
1.Portfolio
2.Index Funds(NIFTY50 & BSE/NSE)
3.Top Gainers
4.Top Losers
